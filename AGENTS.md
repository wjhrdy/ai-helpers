# AI Helpers Marketplace

This repository serves as a collaborative marketplace for AI automation tools, plugins, and assistants designed to enhance productivity across multiple AI platforms. It provides a centralized location for sharing and discovering AI-powered development tools.

## Repository Purpose

The odh-ai-helpers repository hosts collections of four distinct tool types:
- **Skills**: Standardized capabilities using agentskills.io format, compatible with Claude Code and Cursor
- **Commands**: Atomic, executable actions for immediate functionality
- **Agents**: Specialized AI entities for complex, multi-step workflows and analysis
- **Gemini Gems**: Conversational AI assistants optimized for specific domains

This enables teams to automate repetitive tasks, integrate with development tools, and create specialized AI capabilities tailored to specific workflows and needs.

## Tool Types

### Skills
Standardized capabilities that work across multiple AI platforms using the agentskills.io specification. Skills provide reusable functionality with cross-platform compatibility.

**→ Located in [helpers/skills/](helpers/skills/) directory**

### Commands
Atomic, executable actions that provide immediate functionality. Commands are designed for quick, specific tasks and can be invoked directly by AI agents.

**→ Located in [helpers/commands/](helpers/commands/) directory**

### Agents
Specialized AI entities capable of complex reasoning and multi-step workflows. Agents maintain context and can execute sophisticated analysis within their domain of expertise.

**→ Located in [helpers/agents/](helpers/agents/) directory**

### Gemini Gems
Conversational AI assistants created within Google's Gemini platform. Each Gem is tailored with specific instructions and knowledge bases for particular domains or tasks.

**→ For detailed Gemini Gems instructions, see [Gemini Gems README](helpers/gems/README.md)**

## Platform Support

### Claude Code
- **Skills**: Available through marketplace plugin entries
- **Commands**: Available through marketplace plugin entries
- **Agents**: Available as sub-agents through marketplace plugin entries


### OpenCode.ai
- **Skills**: Compatible as OpenCode skills in ~/.config/opencode/skills/
- **Commands**: Compatible as OpenCode commands in ~/.config/opencode/commands/
- **Agents**: Not currently compatible due to format differences

### Cursor AI
- **Skills**: Compatible through agentskills.io format
- **Commands**: Can be adapted for Cursor command structure
- **Agents**: Can be used as specialized workflow guides

## How to Create New Tools

### Development Workflow (All Platforms)

1. **Plan Your Tool**
   - Identify the specific task or workflow to automate
   - Choose the appropriate platform based on requirements
   - Review existing tools to avoid duplication

2. **Follow Platform Guidelines**
   - Read the platform-specific README for detailed instructions
   - Study existing examples in the respective directories
   - Follow naming and structure conventions

3. **Validate and Test**
   ```bash
   make lint      # Validate tool structure
   make update    # Update settings and website data
   ```

4. **Submit Contribution**
   - Test your tool thoroughly
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Submit a merge request with your changes

## Tool Registry

The marketplace uses a centralized category registry in `categories.yaml` to organize specialized tools by category. **Tools not listed in any category are automatically placed in the "General" category**, providing a clean organization system that requires no action from contributors for basic tools.

### Category Registry Structure

Specialized tool categories are defined in `categories.yaml` at the repository root:

```yaml
CategoryName:
  - specialized-tool
  - another-tool

AnotherCategory:
  - domain-specific-tool
```

## Ethical Guidelines

**Critical Requirement**: Never reference real people by name in plugins, commands, or examples.

**Instead of naming people, describe qualities explicitly:**
- ✅ "Write commit messages that are direct, technically precise, and focused on rationale"
- ✅ "Explain using clear analogies, wonder, and accessible language for non-experts"
- ❌ "Write commits in the style of [person's name]"

This ensures consent, prevents misrepresentation, respects intellectual property, and maintains dignity.

## Getting Started

1. **Explore Existing Tools**: Browse [categories.yaml](categories.yaml) for categorized tools or visit our [website](https://opendatahub-io.github.io/ai-helpers/)
2. **Choose Your Platform**: Review platform-specific READMEs for detailed guidance
3. **Study Examples**: Look at existing implementations for structure and patterns
4. **Start Contributing**: Follow the development workflow for your chosen platform
